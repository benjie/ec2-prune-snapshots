# ec2-prune-snapshots

If you're doing `ec2-create-snapshot` frequently, then you'll need to clear those out at some point. `ec2-prune-snapshots` takes all the hassle out of doing this.

## Features

 * Auto-detects all volumes
 * Ensures the most recent snapshot from each volume is not deleted
 * Saves one snapshot per volume on the first day of each month in the last [540] days
 * Saves one snapshot per volume on each Sunday in the last [30] days
 * Saves one snapshot per volume on each day in the last [7] days
 * Saves all snapshots in the last [3] days
 * Handle multiple snapshots per day (by deleting all but the most recent snapshot per volume per day, excluding the last [3] days)
 * Configurable on the command line (see below)
 * Uses the official AWS PHP SDK
 * Uses the UTC timezone, just like AWS, so SHOULD be consistent
   wherever you run it.

## Installing

This project links uses the Amazon AWS SDK for PHP.
You can either use the module from PEAR (in which case you'll need to
modify the source of this script) or pull their version
straight from github. I prefer the latter aproach so I've linked
it as a submodule. To fetch it, simply do the following:

    git clone git://github.com/benjie/ec2-prune-snapshots.git
    cd ec2-prune-snapshots
    git submodule update --init

The AWS SDK for PHP expects your credentials to be in ~/.aws/sdk/config.inc.php
(see [reference](https://aws.amazon.com/articles/4261#configurecredentials))

    mkdir -p ~/.aws/sdk/
    cp sdk/config-sample.inc.php ~/.aws/sdk/config.inc.php
    vim ~/.aws/sdk/config.inc.php

You might need to install PHP5 if you don't already have it. On Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install php5-cli php5-curl

Then you can see what the script would do by running

    php ec2-prune-snapshots.php -v

## Configuration:

From the help message:

    $ php ec2-prune-snapshots.php -h
    ec2-prune-snapshots v0.2 by Benjie Gillam

    This script defaults to no action - specify -d to perform operations.
    Be sure to set your credentials in ~/.aws/sdk/config.inc.php as specified by
      the AWS SDK. See: https://aws.amazon.com/articles/4261#configurecredentials

    Usage:
      -h               Help
      -v               Verbose (specify multiple times for greater verbosity)
      -q               Quiet
      -d               Actually perform operations (delete/do it)
      -a365:30:7:3     Set global options
      -V'vol-abcdefgh:365:30:7:3'    Set options for specific volume

    Options are specified as 4 ages, in days, for each operation
      1st: delete all older snapshots
      2nd: delete older unless 1st of month
      3rd: delete older unless Sunday or 1st of month
      4th: keep only one per day older than this

      Snapshots newer than the 4th parameter will be kept.

# Inspired by

My thanks to [Eric Dasque's ec2-manage-snapshots][ec2-manage-snapshots] which in turn was inspired by [Oren Solomianikâ€™s ec2-delete-old-snapshots][ec2-delete-old-snapshots]. This new version is a ground up rewrite using the newest AWS PHP SDK and implementing slightly more fine grained handling of snapshots.
